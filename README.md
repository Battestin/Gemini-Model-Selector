# Model Selector

Python script that dynamically selects the appropriate Google Gemini model ("gemini-1.5-flash" or "gemini-1.5-pro") based on the token count of the input data. It analyzes customer purchase data and generates a concise customer profile using the Gemini API.

1. Clone the repo  
2. Install dependencies:

3. Create a `.env` file with your API key:  
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
   ```

4. Prepare your input file (CSV or text) and update the file path in the script.

5. Run the script:  
   ```bash
   python model_selector.py
   ```
